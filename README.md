- Officially onboard lecturers together with the courses they teach
- Structure and upload departmental courses (videos, notes, links)
- Use AI to help lecturers create quizzes & notes faster
- Verify student skills with blockchain-backed badges & certificates
- Build a living, verifiable portfolio of future-ready skills for each student
