**UniSkill+** changes this by integrating:

- AI tools to help lecturers build engaging materials faster
- Official departmental course structures, so students register and access the right courses
- Personalized AI recommendations to help students advance in their field
- Blockchain-backed certificates & badges to make these skills verifiable anywhere
- A social space where students with similar interests can chat, collaborate, and network
